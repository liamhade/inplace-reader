Homemade duplicate of the Spritz reader, which
(allegedly) increases reading capacity.

Tips:
* Place <script> with your JS at the bottom of the body, otherwise it runs before the HTML is loaded

Todo:
* Make the Spritz slow down on longer words
* Add night-mode
* Show progress through the article
